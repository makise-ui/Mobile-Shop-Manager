# Product Guidelines: Mobile Shop Manager\n\n## Tone and Voice\n- **Professional & Functional:** The application communicates with clarity and precision. Avoid conversational filler; focus on efficiency and standard business terminology (e.g., "IMEI," "GST," "Inventory").\n- **Instructions:** Use the imperative mood for actions (e.g., "Add File," "Print Label," "Generate Invoice").\n\n## Visual Identity & UI Design\n- **Data-Centric Density:** Prioritize information density. Use compact tables for inventory and clear, contrasting status indicators (e.g., distinct colors for In-Stock vs. Sold).\n- **Responsive Layout:** The interface must adapt gracefully to different screen resolutions, ensuring readability on 13-inch laptops as well as 24-inch monitors.\n- **Clarity over Flourish:** Avoid unnecessary animations or decorative elements that do not contribute to task completion.\n\n## User Experience (UX) Principles\n- **Offline-First Reliability:** All core workflows—inventory management, local billing, and thermal printing—must function without an active internet connection.\n- **Actionable Error Handling:** Errors should be specific and instructive. If a file fails to load, identify the exact row or field causing the issue so the user can resolve it immediately.\n- **Top-Level Navigation:** Use a persistent top navigation bar or tab system for quick access to core modules (Inventory, Billing, Analytics, Settings).\n\n## Reliability & Performance\n- **Data Integrity:** Always prompt for confirmation before destructive actions (e.g., deleting records) and ensure data is auto-saved or backed up to the user's Documents folder.\n- **Fast Execution:** Optimize for speed, especially in the inventory search and label printing processes, to minimize customer wait times in-store.
