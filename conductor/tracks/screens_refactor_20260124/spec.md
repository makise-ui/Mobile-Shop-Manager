# Specification: Modular GUI Screen Refactoring\n\n## Overview\nThis track focuses on decomposing the monolithic \`gui/screens.py\` file into a modular package structure. The current file is becoming complex and difficult to maintain, hindering future development. By organizing screens into separate modules, we improve code readability, simplify testing, and enable easier extension of the UI.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Module Separation:** Create a \`gui/screens/\` directory and move each major screen class (e.g., \`InventoryScreen\`, \`BillingScreen\`, \`SettingsScreen\`) into its own Python file.\n- **Initialization:** Update \`gui/screens/__init__.py\` to handle the necessary imports or factory patterns to maintain compatibility with the main application loop.\n- **Dependency Extraction:** Identify and move common UI components, mixins, and helper functions used across multiple screens into \`gui/widgets.py\` or a dedicated \`gui/base.py\`.\n- **Import Resolution:** Update all internal and external imports (e.g., in \`gui/app.py\`) to point to the new modular structure.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Maintainability:** Reduce the average line count of individual GUI files to under 500 lines.\n- **Readability:** Adhere strictly to the project's Python style guide for the newly created modules.\n- **Zero Behavioral Change:** The refactoring must not change any existing user-facing functionality or visual design.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] \`gui/screens.py\` is removed or replaced by a package.\n- [ ] The application launches successfully and all screens (Inventory, Billing, Settings, Analytics) function as before.\n- [ ] Code coverage for GUI components remains above 80%.\n- [ ] No circular imports are introduced by the refactoring.\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Adding new UI features or changing existing visual styles.\n- Refactoring core backend logic in \`core/\`.
