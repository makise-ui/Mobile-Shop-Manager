# User Guide - 4Bros Mobile Point Manager

## 1. Getting Started

When you launch the application, you will land on the **Inventory Dashboard**. This is the command center for your shop.

### The Dashboard Layout
*   **Search Bar**: Located at the top. Scan a barcode or type a Unique ID / Model name to filter the list instantly.
*   **Inventory Table**: Displays your stock.
    *   **UID**: The 3-character unique code generated by the app.
    *   **Status**: Indicates if an item is `IN`, `OUT` (Sold), or `RTN` (Returned).
    *   **Price**: The selling price (automatically calculated if Markup is enabled).
*   **Action Buttons**: 'Print Checked', 'Billing', 'Refresh', 'Settings'.

## 2. Managing Inventory Files

The app doesn't have its own database for product details. Instead, it reads directly from your Excel files.

1.  Click **Manage Files** (or go to Settings -> File Manager).
2.  Click **Add File** and select your Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV file.
3.  **Column Mapping**: The app will ask you to match your Excel columns to the app's fields:
    *   `Unique ID` (Optional: if your file already has IDs)
    *   `Model Name` (Required)
    *   `IMEI / Serial` (Required for uniqueness)
    *   `Purchase Price` (Required for profit calc)
    *   `Color` (Optional)
4.  Click **Save**. The app will now watch this file. If you edit the Excel file outside the app and save it, the app updates automatically!

## 3. Printing Labels

This feature is designed for 2-up thermal label rolls (50mm x 25mm approx).

1.  In the Inventory Dashboard, verify the items you want to print are checked (checkbox column).
2.  Click **Print Checked**.
3.  A **Preview Window** will appear showing how the labels will be arranged (Left and Right).
4.  Select your printer and click **Print**.
    *   *Tip:* Ensure your Windows Printer preferences are set to the correct label size (e.g., 100mm x 25mm for the full row width).

## 4. Billing & Invoicing

1.  Select items in the Inventory screen.
2.  Click **Go to Billing**.
3.  **Customer Details**: Enter Name and Phone Number.
4.  **Tax**: Toggle `Tax Inclusive` if the price already includes GST.
5.  **Generate**: Click **Generate Invoice**.
6.  A PDF will be created and opened automatically. You can print this on a standard A4 printer.
7.  **Status Update**: The items included in the bill will automatically be marked as **OUT** (Sold) in the system.

## 5. Handling Returns

If a customer returns a phone:
1.  Search for the item by ID or IMEI.
2.  Right-click the item (or use the Status dropdown if available).
3.  Change status to **RTN**.
4.  This prevents the item from being sold again until you inspect it and change it back to **IN**.
