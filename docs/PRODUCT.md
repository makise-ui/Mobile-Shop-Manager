*   **Data Fragmentation:** Eliminates the need to manage multiple, disconnected Excel stock files.
*   **Manual Entry Errors:** Removes the risk of typo-induced inventory mismatches via automated Excel synchronization.
*   **Compliance Complexity:** Simplifies Indian GST invoicing with automated tax calculations (CGST/SGST/IGST).
